                <p>
                    "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted in a damn good cup of coffee Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
                    In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.
